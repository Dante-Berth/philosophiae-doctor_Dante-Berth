## Resume in few words
Paper  presenting the fundamental concepts and theories of Agent based model. [[Agent-Based Models]]

## What is an Agent based model (ABM)?
An agent-based model is indeed focused on representing individual agents and their interactions based on simple rules and local information. These agents can be considered as autonomous entities whose behavior is determined by their local environment and interactions with other agents.
ABM can be seen as electronic laboratories, the aim is to fit the real world by a proposal ABM.
ABM can modelize complex environnement such as market systems, social interactions...

## Why using ABM ?
Systems are more complex in terms of their nonlinearity of features; some systems are still too complex to be modeled with conventional methods. Furthermore, many models rely on strong hypotheses (the article takes, for instance, the market model, such as the Black-Scholes formula). The last argument attempts to propose Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) because nowadays we have the computational power that allows us to do so, whereas in the past it was impossible.

## What is an agent ?

An agent is an autonomous  entity that interacts with its environment and other agents, has the ability to learn and adapt its behaviors based on experiences . Agents interact with other agents through various protocols. They can be diverse, heterogeneous, and dynamic in their attributes and behavioral rules, and their behavior can range from simple to complex, with some agents being adaptive and capable of learning from their environment. An agent have resource attributes such as energy,wealth...

ABM  is equivalent to Agent-based simulation "refers to a model in which the dynamic processes of agent interaction are simulated repeatedly over time, as in systems dynamics, time-stepped, discreteevent, and other types of simulation "

## Hindsight on ABM
ABM related to the field of multi-agent systems.
ABM comes from complex adaptive systems (CAS) " systems are built from the ground-up".
ABM are superior to CAS because theirs goals are to modelize the system but also the behavior of individuals. They do not tend to optimize optimal behaviors.
"John Holland, a pioneer in the field, identifies properties and mechanisms common to all CAS (Holland 1995) such as 
 - (1) Aggregation: allows groups to form, 
 - (2) Nonlinearity: invalidates simple extrapolation, 
 - (3) Flows: allow the transfer and transformation of resources and information 
 - (4) Diversity: allows agents to behave differently from one another and often leads to the system property of robustness. 
CAS mechanisms are: 
- (1) Tagging: allows agents to be named and recognized, 
- (2) Internal models: allows agents to reason about their worlds,  
- (3) Building blocks: allows components and whole systems to be composed of many levels of simpler components."
## Why and When ABM
"
We conclude by offering some ideas on the situations for which agent-based modeling can offer distinct advantages to conventional simulation approaches such as discrete event simulation (Law 2007), systems dynamics (Sterman 2000) and other quantitative modeling techniques. Axtell (2000) discusses several reasons for agent-based modeling especially compared to traditional approaches to modeling economic systems. When is it beneficial to think in terms of agents? When one or more of the following criteria are satisfied: 
- When the problem has a natural representation as being comprised of agents • When there are decisions and behaviors that can be well-defined 
- When it is important that agents have behaviors that reflect how individuals actually behave (if known) 
- When it is important that agents adapt and change their behaviors When it is important that agents learn and engage in dynamic strategic interactions 
- When it is important that agents have a dynamic relationship with other agents, and agent relationships form, change, and decay 
- When it is important to model the processes by which agents form organizations, and adaptation and learning are important at the organization level 
- When it is important that agents have a spatial component to their behaviors and interactions
- When the past is no predictor of the future because the processes of growth and change are dynamic 
- When scaling-up to arbitrary levels is important in terms of the number of agents, agent interactions and agent states 
- When process structural change needs to be an endogenous result of the model, rather than an input to the model
