Overview of ABM  and machine learning methods in biology

## Abstract
ABM is a primitive/prior model, while ML models utilize statistical methods to learn from data. Biology lacks data, so ABM models tend to modelize biological processes through the biases of agents that follow predefined rules. These rules can either be learned from data or developed by experts. ML can assist in inferring optimal, system-specific ABM rules. For more details about ABM refers to [[Agent-Based Models]] and [[AGENT-BASED MODELING AND SIMULATION]].

Moreover, ABM can generate multiple synthetic datasets, which can be reused to enhance the accuracy of ML.



## Introduction 
In the field of biology, numerous questions come to light, including:

1. **Interconnectedness of Individual Entities:**
>[!question]  
> How are the individual entities related or connected to each other?
> What connections exist between these separate entities?
**Example:** In an cancer environnement, how does a change in the population of  lymphocytes  affect the cancer cells that rely on them ?

2. **Impact of Actions and Interactions:**
>[!question]  
>How do the actions and behaviors of these independent agents influence each other?
>What effects do the interactions between these entities have on their behaviors?
>**Example:** How do the behaviors and interactions of lymphocytes  within a cancer environnement affect the overall success of the cancer?

3. **Overall Influence on the Population:**
>[!question]  
> In what ways do the actions and interactions of individual entities impact larger-scale outcomes for the entire population?
>How do these individual behaviors contribute to broader, population-wide results?

"The discretized nature of ABMs, in time and space, allows them to capture the temporal stochasticity and spatial heterogeneities that are inherent to most complex dynamical systems, biological or otherwise. The variabilities that arise from stochasticity and heterogeneity1 can be handled in ABM simulations in a manner that is numerically robust (e.g., to singularities, divergences) and, thus, capable of emulating how real biological processes may progress towards potentially different outcomes (i.e., non-deterministic behavior), based on (i) heterogeneity among the unique agents in a population, (ii) stochasticity at the level of individual agents (i.e. inherent variability stemming from differential responses of each individual agent), or (iii) variability in the environment and the coupling of agents to that potentially dynamic environment" 

ABM is a excellent model which does not suffer from asumptions.
