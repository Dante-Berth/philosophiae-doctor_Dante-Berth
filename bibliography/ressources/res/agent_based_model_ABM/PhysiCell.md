The Goal of [PhysiCell](https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell) is to create a modeling grammar : "a unifying language for modeling diverse biological concepts, transcending the limitations posed by individualized approaches in the realm of agent-based modeling"

In PhysiCell, the team has developed a model grammar containing two dictionaries.
	- a dictionary is dedicated to standard cell process  (behavior) models.
	- a dictionary is dedicated to signals (stimuli) that modulate behaviors
Besides, a grammar which can be viewed as a language connect signals to behavioral responses.
And translate grammar statements into mathematics and code automatically.

## Behaviors in PhysiCell

The dictionary of behaviors is composed of : 9 known behavior and 1 unknown behavior called "custom symbol".
